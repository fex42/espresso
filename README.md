# Espresso Shaking and Distribution Tool

This is an espresso shaking and distribution tool for 58 mm portafilter baskets. It is inspired by the [Weber Workshops Blind Shaker](https://weberworkshops.com/products/blind-shaker).


Lance Hedrick says the Weber Blind Shaker is the best tool for distrubuting espresso grind, I have to try that.

But it was not worth 80 bucks for me, so I have to do that myself using the great [build123d](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Code CAD system.
